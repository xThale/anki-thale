# Anki-Thale

This software enables the upload of [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) cards to my [own flashcard website](https://github.com/xThale/thale-info-backend). This project was used to ease the process of learning new vocabulary or studying. Though mainly for practicing developing skills, especially frontend and cloud deployments. It fetches the cards of the Anki system by accessing their API, mapping them to a fitting format and uploading the data to the REST API of my website.
